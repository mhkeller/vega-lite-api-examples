===

A repository containing [Vega-Lite-API](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite-api/) implementations of all of the examples in the [Vega-Lite gallery](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/).

Contributions welcome!

## Usage

## Notes

As described in [this issue](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite-api/issues/440), the `mark` field may not match the spec.
