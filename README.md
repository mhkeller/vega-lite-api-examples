Vega-Lite API Examples

[![tests](https://github.com/mhkeller/vega-lite-api-examples/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mhkeller/vega-lite-api-examples/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)


A repository containing [Vega-Lite-API](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite-api/) implementations of all of the examples in the [Vega-Lite gallery](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/).

Contributions welcome!

## Usage

Test that all of the chart modules in `src/` return their matching JSON spec defined in `specs/`.

```
npm test
```

## Getting started

See the [`bar_aggregate.vl.js`](./src/bar_aggregate.vl.js) file as an example.

If you want to write an implementation, go to a file in the `src/` folder and create a default function that exports a vega-lite spec. To test it, run `npm test`.

## Notes

As described in [this issue](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite-api/issues/440), the `mark` field may not match the spec.

In the [`arc_pie_pyramid`](src/arc_pie_pyramid.vl.js) file, the ordinal `type` field is added but is not present in the spec: 

```json
"order": {
	"field": "order",
	"type": "ordinal"
}
```
